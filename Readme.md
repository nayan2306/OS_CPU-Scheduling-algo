This Project is about CPU Scheduling Algorithim.

It is developed by 4 young Inspring Minds :

1. Pranav Bagade
2. Shreya Bhalgat
3. Shrirang Godbole
4. Nayan Chandak

In this project we have demonstrated 4 types of algorithms :

1. First come First serve
2. Shortest job
3. Priority Scheduling
4. Round Robin

**User Guide :**

1. Select Any CPU Scheduling Algo
2. Enter the no. of process with their respective burst time, arrival time and priority(in case of priority algorithms only) and Time Quantum (in case of Round robin).Add or delete any process at any time by just clicking the add or delete button.
3. Click the Calculate button, which result in displaying calculated gantt chart and Time-Line Charts along with a final Table showing Waiting Time, Response Time, Completion Time, Turn Around Time and CPU Utilization of the algorithm.
