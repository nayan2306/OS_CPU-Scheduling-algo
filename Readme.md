This Project is about CPU Scheduling Algorithim.

It is developed by 4 young Inspring Minids :

1. Pranav Bagade
2. Shreya Bhalgat
3. Shrirang Godbole
4. Nayan Chandak

In this project we have demonstrate 4 types of algorithm :

1. First come First serve
2. Shortest job
3. Priority Scheduling
4. Round Robin

**User Guide :**

1. Select Any CPU Scheduling Algo
2. Enter the no. of process with their respective burst time,arrival time and priority(in case of priority algorithms only) and Time Quantum (in case of Round robin).Add or delete any process at and time by just clicking the add or delete buttons.
3. Click the Calculate button, which result in displaying caculated gantt chart and Time-Line Charts along with a final Table showing Waiting Time,Response Time,Completion Time,Turn Around Time and CPU Utilization of the algorithm.
